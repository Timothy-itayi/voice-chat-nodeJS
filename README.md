# voice-chat-nodeJS

voice-chat-nodeJS is a project from a tutorial i was following made by Tomomi Imura 

She created a blog called Building A Simple Ai Chatbot With Web Speech API and Nodejs 

the tutorial was a way to help devs understand how to build a web app using WEB Speech apis Speech recognition to listen to the user's voice and send the user's message use API.ai ..


However the Tutorial is outdated as API.ai is deprecated and google now owns it and rebranded it to DialogFLow as a result API.ai is no longer a simple way to access 3rd party Natural-language-processing api for a cute web app.. due to the current timeline of AI dominating our landscape.. in short i will update this project to use something else and hopefully get better at using NOdeJs .. I will see how I go
